    \multirow[t]{7}{=}{I am a 21 year old Software, Bachelor student at Aalbog University (AAU), where I also live.
    In my spare time I enjoy learning new programming relate subjects, either by reading, or working on my own, small projects or on online learning platforms such as LeetCode.
    Examples of these could be firmware developement for my keyboard (QMK), tinkering with my Linux-environment, and optimizing upon that by creating shell-scripts mainly for automatation of tasks.
    Beyond that I also spend my spare time working.
    I have been programming since I was 16 years old.}\\\\[-4pt]
