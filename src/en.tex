    I'm a Master's student in Software Engineering (MSc) at Aalborg University (AAU).
    My programming journey began at 16, and I've since gained hands-on experience in many areas, from firmware development to REST APIs and programming language theory.
    I love programming language theory, especially type systems and static analysis, and enjoy exploring how different paradigms influence software design (currently love functional programming).
    I'm eager to use my technical skills, theoretical knowledge, and passion to solve real-world software challenges.
        %I am a Software Engineering Master (MSc) student at Aalborg University (AAU)% with a fervor for backend and system development.
        %, where my fascination with programming has taken me, on my journey of independent learning since the age of 16.
        %My interests span software development theory, and I've dabbled in backend and system development, gaining hands-on experience in firmware development and task automation using shell-scripts.
        %What truly captivates me is exploring the nuances and constructs of different programming languages, giving me insight in what is best suitable for different problems (Currently love functional programming).
