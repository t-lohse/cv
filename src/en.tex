    I'm a Master's graduate in Software Engineering (MSc) at Aalborg University (AAU).
    My programming journey began at 16, and I've since gained hands-on experience in many areas, from firmware development to web developmet to programming language theory.
    I love programming language theory, especially type systems and static analysis, and enjoy exploring how different paradigms influence software design (currently love functional programming).
    I'm eager to use my technical skills, theoretical knowledge, and passion to solve real-world software challenges.

\subsection*{About me}
\secsep
\setlength{\parskip}{1ex}
In my sparetime, I enjoy staying active through lifting weights or bike cycling, which helps me clear my mind and stay focused, fit, and calm.
It’s a great way to challenge myself and set new goals, both physically and mentally.\par

\noindent
I also love watching different movies, series, or playing story-driven games, it’s a great way to relax and get lost and invested in different stories.

\noindent
Additionally, I enjoy discovering and trying different programming language concepts, primarily in the functional programming realm.
I like to do small coding exercises, and the occasional side project, it helps me stay active development-wise
